//! Passive per-server health for Electrum backends — issue #98, Phase 0.
//!
//! One [`ServerHealth`] cell per `(coin_id, url)`, handed out by a
//! process-wide registry so every holder of a connection to the same server
//! feeds the same cell: the engine's pooled [`crate::chain::ElectrumBackend`]
//! AND the wallet sync worker's private one (they deliberately keep separate
//! sockets — one caller domain each, issue #87 — but they are views of the
//! same server, so their health must be one fact, not two).
//!
//! Health is **observed, never probed**: every real request already
//! succeeds or fails and takes a measurable time, and that is the only
//! input. Nothing here dials a server, and nothing here *blocks* one —
//! Phase 0 records only. (Phase 1's `ServerSet` turns the recorded state
//! into skip/promote routing decisions; the `serverstatus` RPC and the
//! Network page render it.)
//!
//! Failure counting is deduplicated **per connection generation**: several
//! engine calls can share one broken socket (the connection is behind an
//! `RwLock` and cloned around), and when it dies they all fail together —
//! that is ONE server incident, not N, or a single hiccup would leap the
//! backoff straight to its cap.
