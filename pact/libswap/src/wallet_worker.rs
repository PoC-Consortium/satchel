//! Background Electrum sync worker for the nodeless wallet (issue #87).
//!
//! One plain `std::thread` per nodeless coin, owning its own long-lived
//! Electrum connection ([`ElectrumBackend`]) to the coin's primary server —
//! deliberately separate from the pooled connection the (registry-lock-
//! serialized) engine calls share, so each socket has exactly one caller at
//! a time and every blocking call stays bounded by the socket timeouts.
//! Its loop:
//!
//! `wait(poke OR ~15s tick)` → observe (subscriptions, tip poll) →
//! **snapshot** revealed spks under a brief wallet-entry lock → **fetch**
//! batched with NO locks held → **apply** via bdk `apply_update` + persist
//! under a brief entry lock (the split lives in
//! [`crate::wallet_bdk::sync_wallet`]).
//!
//! This turns wallet RPC reads into pure cache hits (~0ms, never network —
//! see `BdkWalletBackend::with_wallet`) and caps server traffic at the
//! worker cadence regardless of how hard the UI polls. Freshness comes from
//! the cadence plus **pokes** (after our own broadcasts, on Receive-dialog
//! opens, on swap events touching the coin) plus `scripthash.subscribe`
//! push notifications: the worker subscribes every revealed spk, so a
//! status change (incoming funds, a confirmation) is picked up at the next
//! socket read instead of waiting for a blind re-scan; unchanged statuses
//! let the tick skip the sync entirely — an idle tick is ONE round-trip
//! (the tip poll, which doubles as keep-alive).
//!
//! Race-safety: wallet mutation stays under the per-coin entry mutex; the
//! worker never touches the engine store/registry lock. The one new
//! primitive is the `first_sync_done` latch — wallet WRITES wait on it
//! (bounded) so a spend can never coin-select from a cache that has not
//! seen the chain this run; see `BdkWalletBackend::with_synced_wallet`.
//!
//! Lifecycle: the thread holds only a `Weak` wallet handle and a shutdown
//! flag — it exits when the merchant unloads (its [`WalletManager`] drops)
//! or pactd stops. A dead server makes reads *stale*, not slow: the worker
//! reconnects with backoff while RPC reads keep serving the cache.
//!
//! [`WalletManager`]: crate::wallet_bdk::WalletManager
